# sid — Examples Specification

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-04-11
**Reference:** Companion to [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md). Where `SPEC.md` defines
the binding behavior of the algorithmic functions, this document defines
the binding structure of the example suite shipped with every language
port.

---

> **Implementation status.** This specification is authored against the
> Python example suite on branch `claude/smd-util-helpers` (Phase B). The
> MATLAB port, Julia port, and any future language port MUST conform to
> this document. The Python port is the v1.0.0 reference implementation
> of this spec.

## 0. Preamble

### 0.1 Scope

This document is the **source of truth** for the 11 examples that ship
with the sid toolbox in `{lang}/examples/`. It specifies:

- The physical plants the examples use and their parameters (§1).
- The mathematical definition of the `util_msd*` helper functions that
  build the plants (§2).
- For each example: the goal, the plant, the excitation, the required
  pedagogical sections, the `sid.*` function calls that MUST appear, and
  the plots and prints that MUST be produced (§3).
- The conventions every port must follow (§4).
- The definition of "equal" across languages (§5).
- Versioning and change control rules (§6).

### 0.2 Requirement levels

This document uses the RFC 2119 / BCP 14 key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**,
**SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, and **MAY**. MUST statements are binding —
any implementation that violates one is non-conformant. SHOULD statements
are recommendations: violations must be justified and documented. MAY is
purely informational.

Throughout this document, MUST statements apply to **every language port**.

### 0.3 Binding vs advisory aspects

| Aspect of an example | Requirement level |
|---|---|
| Plant parameters (m, k, c, Ts, N) | MUST match §1 |
| Plant topology (n-mass chain, SDOF, Duffing) | MUST |
| Ordered list of pedagogical sections | MUST |
| Section topic (what each section teaches) | MUST |
| Exact section-header prose | SHOULD |
| Exact markdown / block-comment body prose | SHOULD |
| `sid.*` function calls invoked in each section | MUST |
| Options passed to those calls (window size, grid, λ, etc.) | MUST |
| Plot kinds (Bode, spectrum, map, spectrogram, line chart) | MUST |
| Plot title *topic* and axis label *quantities* | MUST |
| Plot title/label exact wording | SHOULD |
| Plot cosmetics (colors, line widths, figure sizes, fonts) | MAY |
| Printed line *semantics* (what each print conveys) | MUST |
| Exact printed string format | SHOULD |
| Helper function mathematical definition | MUST |
| Helper function names per language | SHOULD (see §2) |
| RNG seed choice | MAY |
| Numerical values produced at runtime | MAY |

In short: a port MUST match the pedagogical skeleton and the `sid.*`
call graph; it MAY use language-idiomatic phrasing, styling, and RNG
seeds.

### 0.4 Why a unified spring-mass-damper plant family?

Every example in this specification is built on a common family of
spring-mass-damper (SMD) plants, ranging from a 1-DoF oscillator to a
3-mass chain, with variants that are linear, linearly time-varying,
and nonlinear (Duffing hardening). Using one physical plant family
across the tutorial suite keeps the narrative concrete and cumulative:
a reader working through the examples sees the same physical systems
again and again, picking up new analysis tools on familiar territory.

Arbitrary `lfilter` coefficients or handcrafted state-space matrices
are explicitly rejected — they have no physical interpretation, their
pole locations are chosen numerically rather than from first
principles, and they make the pedagogical content artificial.

### 0.5 Document structure

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| §1 | Plant catalog (five plants A–E) |
| §2 | Helper API (`util_msd*` mathematical contract) |
| §3 | Example catalog (eleven examples) |
| §4 | Conventions (auto-discovery, self-containment, RNG, naming) |
| §5 | Cross-language "equivalence" (what "equal" means) |
| §6 | Versioning and change control |
| §7 | References |

## 1. Plant Catalog

Every example in this specification uses one or more of the five plants
defined below. Each plant has a fixed set of physical parameters; the
parameters MUST NOT be changed by a language port without a corresponding
version bump of this specification (see §6).

The plants are referred to by their catalog letter (Plant A, Plant B, …)
throughout §3. When an example refers to a plant it MUST use the
parameters defined here.

### 1.1 Plant A — 1-DoF spring-mass-damper (SDOF)

**Physical story.** A single mass connected to a fixed wall through a
linear spring and a viscous damper — the canonical textbook oscillator.
A force is applied at the mass and the measured output is the mass
position.

**Continuous-time dynamics.**

```
m x''(t) + c x'(t) + k x(t) = u(t)
```

**State vector.** `[x; v]` with `x` position and `v = x'` velocity.

**Parameters.**

| Symbol | Value | Units | Derived |
|---|---|---|---|
| `m`  | `1.0`   | kg       | |
| `k`  | `100.0` | N/m      | `ω_n = sqrt(k/m) = 10 rad/s ≈ 1.59 Hz` |
| `c`  | `2.0`   | N·s/m    | `ζ = c / (2 sqrt(k m)) = 0.1`, `Q = 5` |
| `F`  | `[[1]]` | (n×q)    | force applied directly at the single mass |
| `Ts` | `0.01`  | s        | `fs = 100 Hz`, Nyquist `= π/Ts ≈ 314 rad/s` |

**Discretization testpoint.** Under `util_msd(m, k, c, F, Ts)` (see §2.1):

```
Ad ≈ [[ 0.9950372995,  0.0098841706],
      [-0.9884170600,  0.9752689583]]

Bd ≈ [[ 4.9627005463e-05],
      [ 9.8841705996e-03]]
```

A conforming implementation MUST reproduce these to at least `1e-9`
relative tolerance for this exact `(m, k, c, F, Ts)` tuple.

**Used by.** §3.1 `siso`, §3.2 `etfe`, §3.5 `method_comparison`, §3.9
`ltv_disc` (main LTV section, plus the Duffing linearization reuses
Plant A's `m`, `k_lin`, `c`).

---

### 1.2 Plant B — 2-mass chain

**Physical story.** Two equal masses in series, anchored to a wall
through the first spring. Naturally exhibits a 2×2 force-to-position
MIMO response with cross-coupling through the second spring.

**Topology.** `wall──k₁──m₁──k₂──m₂`

**Continuous-time dynamics.**

```
M x''(t) + C x'(t) + K x(t) = F u(t)
```

with `M = diag(m)` and tridiagonal `K`, `C` built from `k_spring`,
`c_damp` per §2.1.

**State vector.** `[x₁, x₂, v₁, v₂]`.

**Parameters.**

| Symbol | Value | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `m` | `[1, 1]`    | kg    | equal masses |
| `k` | `[100, 80]` | N/m   | `k[0]` wall→m₁, `k[1]` m₁→m₂ |
| `c` | `[2, 2]`    | N·s/m | |
| `Ts`| `0.01`      | s     | |

**Normal modes.** `ω_modes ≈ [5.97, 14.98] rad/s` (obtained as square
roots of the sorted eigenvalues of `M⁻¹K`).

**Input distribution matrix `F`.** Depends on example:

- For `mimo` (§3.6), `coherence` (§3.4) sections that use a second
  input for an unmodeled disturbance: `F = I₂` (two independent force
  channels).
- For `freq_map` (§3.7), `multi_trajectory` (§3.10 sections 1–2, 4),
  `output_cosmic` (§3.11): `F = [[1], [0]]` (force at mass 1 only).

**Discretization testpoint.** Under `util_msd(m=[1,1], k=[100,80],
c=[2,2], F=[[1],[0]], Ts=0.01)`:

```
Ad ≈ [[ 9.9116061487e-01,  3.9125769853e-03,  9.7740440835e-03,  1.1093285197e-04],
      [ 3.9060177716e-03,  9.9605789532e-01,  1.1093285197e-04,  9.8882565423e-03],
      [-1.7504533069e+00,  7.7304889853e-01,  9.5228630424e-01,  2.3238799448e-02],
      [ 7.7109261003e-01, -7.8218589523e-01,  2.3238799448e-02,  9.7650324794e-01]]

Bd ≈ [[4.9268081419e-05],
      [3.6086910233e-07],
      [9.7740440835e-03],
      [1.1093285197e-04]]
```

A conforming implementation MUST reproduce these to at least `1e-9`
relative tolerance.

**Used by.** §3.4 `coherence`, §3.6 `mimo`, §3.7 `freq_map`, §3.10
`multi_trajectory` (sections 1, 2, 4), §3.11 `output_cosmic`.

---

### 1.3 Plant C — 3-mass chain

**Physical story.** Three masses in series, anchored to a wall through
the first spring. Three well-separated bending-mode-like resonances in
the bottom decade of the spectrum; the canonical plant for
demonstrating frequency-dependent resolution.

**Topology.** `wall──k₁──m₁──k₂──m₂──k₃──m₃`

**Parameters.**

| Symbol | Value | Units | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `m` | `[1, 1, 1]`     | kg    | equal masses |
| `k` | `[300, 200, 100]` | N/m | stiffness *decreases* toward the free end |
| `c` | `[8, 8, 8]`     | N·s/m | |
| `F` | `[[1], [0], [0]]` | (3×1) | force at mass 1 only |
| `Ts`| `0.01`          | s     | |

**Normal modes.** `ω_modes ≈ [6.45, 15.15, 25.08] rad/s`.

**Physical interpretation.** A slender cantilever-like structure with
diminishing stiffness toward the tip — the three modes are close enough
to challenge a short-window BT estimator but far enough apart to be
resolved by a long window or by frequency-dependent resolution.

**Discretization testpoint.** Under `util_msd`:

```
Ad ≈ [[ 0.97662704,  0.00906461,  0.00012791,  0.00917488,  0.00038846,  0.00001056],
      [ 0.00882163,  0.98617894,  0.00460777,  0.00038846,  0.00921581,  0.00038430],
      [ 0.00024562,  0.00448490,  0.99526154,  0.00001056,  0.00038430,  0.00960491],
      [-4.50974587,  1.71949205,  0.03779075,  0.83293672,  0.07633266,  0.00315117],

Bd ≈ [[4.7268e-05], [1.3055e-06], [2.6458e-08],
      [9.1749e-03], [3.8846e-04], [1.0555e-05]]
```

Trailing digits shown to the spec's working precision. A conforming
implementation MUST reproduce these to at least `1e-6` relative
tolerance.

**Used by.** §3.3 `freq_dep_res`.

---

### 1.4 Plant D — SDOF for spectrogram (high-frequency SDOF)

**Physical story.** A 1-DoF oscillator scaled to a structural-acoustic
frequency range so it can be driven by an audible chirp and analyzed
with a short-time FFT. Models a stiff mechanical resonator
(`ω_n ≈ 32 Hz`) with moderate damping — the sort of plant you would
hit with an impact hammer in a lab modal test.

**Parameters.**

| Symbol | Value | Units | Derived |
|---|---|---|---|
| `m` | `1.0`     | kg     | |
| `k` | `4·10⁴`   | N/m    | `ω_n = 200 rad/s ≈ 31.83 Hz` |
| `c` | `20.0`    | N·s/m  | `ζ = 0.05`, `Q = 10` |
| `F` | `[[1]]`   | (1×1)  | force at the mass |
| `Ts`| `0.001`   | s      | `fs = 1000 Hz`, Nyquist `= 500 Hz` |

**Discretization testpoint.** Under `util_msd`:

```
Ad ≈ [[ 0.98019872,  0.00098348],
      [-39.33916499,  0.96052913]]

Bd ≈ [[ 4.9503206884e-07],
      [ 9.8347912463e-04]]
```

Relative tolerance `1e-9`.

**Used by.** §3.8 `spectrogram`, §3.10 `multi_trajectory` (section 3 —
chirp-in-noise).

---

### 1.5 Plant E — Duffing hardening SDOF (nonlinear)

**Physical story.** A 1-DoF oscillator with a **cubic stiffness** term
superposed on the linear spring. Physically models a hardening rubber
mount, a geometrically-nonlinear thin plate, or a pre-stressed
structure whose restoring force grows faster than linearly with
displacement.

**Continuous-time dynamics.**

```
m x''(t) + c x'(t) + k_lin x(t) + k_cub x(t)³ = u(t)
```

**State vector.** `[x; v]`.

**Parameters.**

| Symbol  | Value   | Units   | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `m`     | `1.0`   | kg      | same mass as Plant A |
| `k_lin` | `100.0` | N/m     | linear component (Plant A's spring) |
| `k_cub` | `1·10⁵` | N/m³    | hardening; dominates at `|x| ≳ 0.03 m` |
| `c`     | `2.0`   | N·s/m   | linear damping (Plant A's damper) |
| `F`     | `[[1]]` | (1×1)   | force at the mass |
| `Ts`    | `0.01`  | s       | same as Plant A |

**Effective natural frequency** (small-signal linearization around
displacement `x`):

```
ω_eff(x) = sqrt( (k_lin + 3 k_cub x²) / m )
```

At `x = 0`: `ω_eff = 10 rad/s` (Plant A's baseline).
At `x = 0.05 m`: `ω_eff ≈ 21.8 rad/s` (a ~2× frequency shift).

**Integration.** This plant cannot be discretized with exact ZOH
(`expm`) because it is nonlinear. It MUST be simulated with the RK4
integrator specified in §2.3, operating on the continuous-time RHS.

**Integration testpoint.** With `m=1`, `k_lin=100`, `k_cub=1e5`,
`c=2`, `F=[[1]]`, `Ts=0.01`, `substeps=1`, initial state `x0 = 0`,
and impulse input `u = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (one step):

```
x_traj[1] ≈ [4.9626666641e-05, 9.8841633080e-03]
x_traj[2] ≈ [1.4707706719e-04, 9.5906651394e-03]
x_traj[3] ≈ [2.4114284377e-04, 9.2080973779e-03]
x_traj[4] ≈ [3.3096036948e-04, 8.7419986134e-03]
x_traj[5] ≈ [4.1572503242e-04, 8.1986213117e-03]
```

Relative tolerance `1e-6`. A conforming implementation MUST also
satisfy the **reduction-to-linear** test: setting `k_cub = 0` and
calling the RK4 integrator with `substeps ≥ 4` MUST reproduce the
exact ZOH result from §2.1 on the same input to within `1e-8`
absolute (fifth-order RK4 truncation error at `Ts = 0.01`).

**Used by.** §3.7 `freq_map` (Duffing section), §3.9 `ltv_disc`
(Duffing linearization section).

---

## 2. Helper API (`util_msd*`)

Every language port MUST provide three helper functions that build the
plants defined in §1 from their physical parameters. The mathematical
definitions below are binding. Function *names* follow the local
language's naming convention (`util_msd` in Python, `util_msd.m` in
MATLAB, etc.); what matters is that exactly three functions with the
semantics defined here are available to the example suite.

The three helpers are:

- **§2.1** The LTI helper — builds `(Ad, Bd)` for a time-invariant
  n-mass chain via exact zero-order-hold discretization.
- **§2.2** The LTV helper — builds per-step `(Ad(k), Bd(k))` stacks for
  chains whose parameters vary in time.
- **§2.3** The nonlinear simulator — integrates an n-mass chain with
  Duffing-style cubic stiffness via fixed-step RK4.

### 2.1 LTI helper

#### 2.1.1 Construction of `K` and `C`

Given physical parameters `m`, `k_spring`, `c_damp` (all length-`n`
vectors with positive entries), construct `n × n` tridiagonal matrices:

```
K[i, i]   = k_spring[i] + k_spring[i+1]     for i = 0, …, n-2
K[n-1, n-1] = k_spring[n-1]
K[i, i+1] = K[i+1, i] = -k_spring[i+1]      for i = 0, …, n-2
```

with `C` built by the same pattern from `c_damp`. This is the standard
chain topology `wall──k₁──m₁──k₂──m₂──…──kₙ──mₙ`, where `k_spring[0]`
is the wall-to-mass-1 spring and `k_spring[i]` (for `i ≥ 1`) connects
mass `i` to mass `i+1`.

#### 2.1.2 Continuous-time state-space model

With `M = diag(m)`, `M⁻¹ = diag(1/m)`, and the force distribution
matrix `F` of shape `n × q`:

```
Ac = [[  0_{n×n},      I_{n×n} ],
      [ -M⁻¹ K,       -M⁻¹ C   ]]    (shape 2n × 2n)

Bc = [[  0_{n×q}              ],
      [  M⁻¹ F                ]]    (shape 2n × q)
```

The state vector is `[x₁, x₂, …, xₙ, v₁, v₂, …, vₙ]`: positions first,
velocities second.

#### 2.1.3 Exact zero-order-hold discretization

For sample time `Ts > 0`:

```
Ad = expm(Ac · Ts)
Bd = Ac⁻¹ · (Ad - I_{2n}) · Bc
```

The implementation MUST use a library-quality matrix exponential
(`expm` in MATLAB/Octave/SciPy). Taylor-series or Pade truncations
below 6th order are non-conformant because the discretization testpoints
in §1 are tabulated to `1e-9` relative tolerance.

#### 2.1.4 Interface (binding)

Inputs:

| Name | Shape | Type | Constraint |
|---|---|---|---|
| `m` | `(n,)` | real | entries > 0 |
| `k_spring` | `(n,)` | real | entries > 0 |
| `c_damp` | `(n,)` | real | entries ≥ 0 |
| `F` | `(n, q)` | real | — |
| `Ts` | scalar | real | `Ts > 0` |

Outputs:

| Name | Shape | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `Ad` | `(2n, 2n)` | real |
| `Bd` | `(2n, q)` | real |

The function MUST reject mismatched shapes (e.g., `len(k_spring) ≠
len(m)`) with an error. A one-column `F` passed as a `(n,)` vector
MAY be auto-reshaped.

#### 2.1.5 Numerical testpoints

These are the same testpoints tabulated in §1. A conforming LTI helper
MUST reproduce them:

| Plant | Tuple | Tolerance |
|---|---|---|
| Plant A | `util_msd([1], [100], [2], [[1]], 0.01)` | rel 1e-9 |
| Plant B | `util_msd([1,1], [100,80], [2,2], [[1],[0]], 0.01)` | rel 1e-9 |
| Plant C | `util_msd([1,1,1], [300,200,100], [8,8,8], [[1],[0],[0]], 0.01)` | rel 1e-6 |
| Plant D | `util_msd([1], [4e4], [20], [[1]], 0.001)` | rel 1e-9 |

Ports SHOULD also include `n = 2` and `n = 5` regression tests (not
tabulated here) whose expected outputs are computed from the
continuous closed form against the modal decomposition.

---

### 2.2 LTV helper

#### 2.2.1 Contract

The LTV helper builds a stack of per-step `(Ad(k), Bd(k))` matrices for
an n-mass chain whose parameters vary over `N` sample steps. It MUST
be semantically equivalent to calling the LTI helper (§2.1) once per
time index:

```
for k in 0..N-1:
    Ad_stack[:, :, k], Bd_stack[:, :, k] = util_msd(
        m(k), k_spring(k), c_damp(k), F(k), Ts
    )
```

A conforming implementation MAY take a fast path when all of `m`,
`k_spring`, `c_damp`, `F` are time-invariant (call `util_msd` once and
broadcast the result along a newly introduced time axis).

#### 2.2.2 Interface (binding)

Inputs:

| Name | Allowed shapes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `m` | `(n,)` or `(n, N)` | constant or per-step |
| `k_spring` | `(n,)` or `(n, N)` | constant or per-step |
| `c_damp` | `(n,)` or `(n, N)` | constant or per-step |
| `F` | `(n, q)` or `(n, q, N)` | constant or per-step |
| `Ts` | scalar | `Ts > 0` |
| `N` (optional) | integer | required only when every other input is constant |

**`N` inference.** The function MUST infer `N` from the first time-
varying input it sees. If every input is constant, the function MUST
require the caller to pass `N` explicitly; in that case the result is
the LTI pair replicated `N` times along the new axis.

**Dimension consistency.** The function MUST raise an error if the
time axes of two different time-varying inputs disagree (e.g.,
`k_spring` has 80 columns but `c_damp` has 100).

Outputs:

| Name | Shape |
|---|---|
| `Ad_stack` | `(2n, 2n, N)` |
| `Bd_stack` | `(2n, q, N)` |

#### 2.2.3 Testpoint

With `m = [1]`, `c_damp = [2]`, `F = [[1]]`, `Ts = 0.01`, and
`k_spring` a single-row `(1, 10)` array built as
`linspace(200, 50, 10)` (1-DoF with `k` ramping 200 → 50 over 10
samples):

```
Ad_stack[:, :, 0] ≈ [[ 0.9900828576,  0.0098676943],
                     [-1.9735388683,  0.9703474690]]

Ad_stack[:, :, -1] ≈ [[ 0.9975176169,  0.0098924149],
                      [-0.4946207456,  0.9777327870]]
```

Relative tolerance `1e-9`.

#### 2.2.4 LTI collapse check

Calling the LTV helper with 1-D `m`, `k_spring`, `c_damp`, 2-D `F`,
and `N = 50` MUST produce an `Ad_stack` whose every slice
`Ad_stack[:, :, k]` is bit-identical (not merely numerically equal)
to `util_msd(m, k_spring, c_damp, F, Ts)`. A conforming implementation
SHOULD take the fast path in this case.

---

### 2.3 Nonlinear simulator (Duffing-style cubic stiffness)

#### 2.3.1 Continuous-time RHS

Given a state vector `state = [x; v]` of length `2n` with
`x = state[0:n]` (positions) and `v = state[n:2n]` (velocities), and
an instantaneous input vector `u_k` of length `q`, the RHS is:

```
net_force[0]     = -( k_lin[0] · x[0] + k_cub[0] · x[0]³ + c_damp[0] · v[0] )

for i in 1..n-1:
    Δx = x[i] - x[i-1]
    Δv = v[i] - v[i-1]
    f_i = k_lin[i] · Δx + k_cub[i] · Δx³ + c_damp[i] · Δv
    net_force[i-1] += f_i
    net_force[i]   -= f_i

net_force += F · u_k                         (external force injection)

acc = net_force / m                          (element-wise)

d state / dt = [v; acc]
```

This implements the chain topology of §1 with a cubic stiffness
contribution on each spring. Setting `k_cub = zeros(n)` reduces the
RHS exactly to the linear dynamics of §2.1.2.

#### 2.3.2 Integration — fixed-step RK4 with zero-order-hold input

Let `h = Ts / substeps`, where `substeps` is an integer ≥ 1.

For each sample step `k = 0, 1, …, N-1`, hold the input `u[k]`
constant over the interval `[k·Ts, (k+1)·Ts)` and take `substeps`
classic RK4 steps of size `h`:

```
for _ in 1..substeps:
    k₁ = rhs(state,              u[k])
    k₂ = rhs(state + 0.5·h·k₁,   u[k])
    k₃ = rhs(state + 0.5·h·k₂,   u[k])
    k₄ = rhs(state + h·k₃,       u[k])
    state = state + (h/6) · (k₁ + 2 k₂ + 2 k₃ + k₄)
```

The `rhs` function is the one defined in §2.3.1. The same `u[k]` is
used for all four stage evaluations (zero-order hold).

The implementation MUST use this exact tableau. Variable-step integrators
(`ode45`, `RK45` with adaptive step) are non-conformant because their
outputs would differ from the tabulated testpoint in §1.5.

#### 2.3.3 Interface (binding)

Inputs:

| Name | Shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `m`       | `(n,)`    | entries > 0 |
| `k_lin`   | `(n,)`    | linear spring constants |
| `k_cub`   | `(n,)`    | cubic spring constants; zeros → linear plant |
| `c_damp`  | `(n,)`    | entries ≥ 0 |
| `F`       | `(n, q)`  | force distribution |
| `Ts`      | scalar    | `Ts > 0` |
| `u`       | `(N, q)`  | input time series |
| `x0`      | `(2n,)`   | initial state (MAY default to zeros) |
| `substeps` | integer  | RK4 sub-steps per `Ts` (MAY default to 1) |

Output:

| Name | Shape |
|---|---|
| `x_traj` | `(N + 1, 2n)` |

`x_traj[0]` MUST equal `x0`; `x_traj[k+1]` is the state after stepping
through `u[k]` for one sample period.

#### 2.3.4 Numerical testpoint — impulse response

With `m = [1]`, `k_lin = [100]`, `k_cub = [1e5]`, `c_damp = [2]`,
`F = [[1]]`, `Ts = 0.01`, `u = [[1], [0], [0], [0], [0]]`, `x0 = 0`,
`substeps = 1`:

```
x_traj[1] ≈ [4.9626666641e-05, 9.8841633080e-03]
x_traj[2] ≈ [1.4707706719e-04, 9.5906651394e-03]
x_traj[3] ≈ [2.4114284377e-04, 9.2080973779e-03]
x_traj[4] ≈ [3.3096036948e-04, 8.7419986134e-03]
x_traj[5] ≈ [4.1572503242e-04, 8.1986213117e-03]
```

Relative tolerance `1e-6`.

#### 2.3.5 Reduction-to-linear check

Setting `k_cub = zeros(n)` and calling the nonlinear simulator with
`substeps ≥ 4` MUST reproduce the ZOH result of §2.1 on the same
linear `(m, k_lin, c_damp, F, Ts, u)` tuple to within `1e-8` absolute
tolerance. This catches tableau errors and chain-assembly mismatches
between the LTI and nonlinear helpers.

## 3. Example Catalog

This section specifies the eleven examples that MUST ship with every
language port. Each example has a **canonical identifier** (e.g.,
`siso`, `freq_dep_res`) that is language-neutral. The file-name mapping
for each identifier is in §4.5.

Per §0.3, the structure below is binding: the plant, excitation,
section order, `sid.*` calls, and plot/print outputs. The exact prose
of markdown cells or block comments is advisory.

Every example MUST:

- Start with a title cell or comment block carrying the canonical
  identifier and a one-paragraph description of the goal.
- Import the local `sid` module and the local `util_msd*` helpers
  (see §2). Additional imports (numpy/scipy, plotting library,
  language-idiomatic tools) are allowed.
- Generate its own data via the helper API — no external data files.
- Produce the required plots and prints.
- Be reproducible within a single language invocation: fix an RNG seed
  at the top of the data-generation section.

### 3.1 `siso` — SISO frequency response with Blackman-Tukey

residual analysis, fit comparison, time-series mode).

**Plant.** Plant A (§1.1) with `N = 2048` samples.

**Excitation.** Unit-variance Gaussian white force `u[k] ~ N(0, 1)`.
Measured output `y[k] = x₁[k] + ε[k]` where `ε[k] ~ N(0, 2·10⁻⁴)` is
additive sensor noise.

BT estimator on the same plant (§3.1).

**Plant.** Plant A (§1.1) with `N = 2048` samples. Same `(m, k, c)` as

### 3.3 `freq_dep_res` — Frequency-dependent resolution

fixed BT window smears the mode structure but a per-frequency window
resolves it cleanly. Show both the scalar-R and vector-R cases.

**Plant.** Plant C (§1.3) with `N = 6000` samples.

**Excitation.** Unit-variance white force at mass 1. Measurement noise
`ε ~ N(0, 5·10⁻⁴)` on `x₁`.

**Required sections.**

| # | Section title (SHOULD) | Topic (MUST) |

### 3.4 `coherence` — Coherence analysis

**Goal.** Use squared coherence `γ²(ω)` to diagnose frequency-local
estimate quality. Show how a colored disturbance entering a plant via
an unmeasured channel depresses coherence in its own spectral band.

**Plant.** Plant B (§1.2) with two input channels:

- Channel 0: commanded force at mass 1, `F_col_0 = [1, 0]`.
- Channel 1: unmeasured disturbance at mass 2, `F_col_1 = [0, 1]`.

`F = [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = I₂`, `N = 4000` samples.

**Excitation.**

- Commanded force `u[k] = 10 · ξ[k]` with `ξ[k] ~ N(0, 1)`.
- Disturbance `d[k] = 0.5 · AR1(e)[k]` where `e[k] ~ N(0, 1)` is white
  noise and `AR1` denotes `y[k] = 0.9 y[k-1] + e[k]` (AR(1) pole at
  0.9, a DC-heavy colored process).

Measured output `y[k] = x₁[k]` (no sensor noise — the coherence drop
must come from the disturbance, not from additive noise).

**Required sections.**

| # | Section title (SHOULD) | Topic (MUST) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Generate test data | Build `(Ad, Bd)` with `F = I₂` via §2.1 so the returned `Bd` has both channels. Simulate `x[k+1] = Ad x[k] + Bd[:,0] u[k] + Bd[:,1] d[k]`. |

| Plot (coherence overlay) | 5 | Two curves labeled "low disturbance" and "high disturbance". |
| Print | 6 | One line: "ETFE coherence is None: True". |

### 3.5 `method_comparison` — Comparing frequency-domain estimators

**Goal.** Apply all three frequency-domain estimators (`freq_bt`,
`freq_btfdr`, `freq_etfe`) to one plant, compare magnitudes, noise
spectra, and NRMSE fits; end with a summary table of trade-offs.

**Plant.** Plant A (§1.1) with `N = 2048` samples. Same plant as §3.1
and §3.2 — enabling direct BT-vs-ETFE-vs-BTFDR comparison.

**Excitation.** Same as §3.1.

### 3.6 `mimo` — Multi-input multi-output frequency response

that has natural 2×2 force-to-position structure. Inspect the
`response.shape == (nf, ny, nu)` dimension and the noise spectral
matrix's off-diagonal entries.

**Plant.** Plant B (§1.2). Two sub-sections use two different
input-distribution matrices:

- Sub-section A (2-output, 1-input): `F = [[1], [0]]`, `N = 4000`.
- Sub-section B (2-output, 2-input): `F = I₂`, `N = 4000`.

**Excitation.**

- Sub-section A: white unit-variance force `u` on channel 0.

  channels.

### 3.7 `freq_map` — Time-varying frequency response maps

**Goal.** Demonstrate `freq_map` on four scenarios: an LTI baseline
(should look stationary), two LTV variants (ramp and step change
built via §2.2), and a nonlinear hardening Duffing oscillator whose
apparent resonance drifts purely from nonlinearity (via §2.3).

**Plants.** Plant B (§1.2) for sections 1–3, 5–7. Plant E (§1.5) for
section 4 (Duffing). Section lengths: `N = 4000` for Plant B LTI,
`N = 4000` for the LTV variants, `N = 4000` for Duffing.

**Excitation.**

- Plant B sections: white unit-variance force at mass 1.
- Duffing section: `u[k] = amp[k] · ξ[k]` where `amp` ramps linearly
  from `0.5` to `10.0` over the record and `ξ[k] ~ N(0, 1)` — a
  ramped-amplitude white force.

Measurement noise `5·10⁻⁴` on the Plant B sections; none on Duffing
(the pedagogical point is purely in the nonlinearity).

**Required sections.**

| # | Section title (SHOULD) | Topic (MUST) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | LTI baseline: constant 2-mass chain | Build Plant B via §2.1, simulate, call `freq_map`. The magnitude map should look constant along time. |
| 2 | Continuous LTV: ramping first-spring stiffness | Build `k_spring` as a `(2, N)` array with `k[0, :]` a linspace `200 → 20` and `k[1, :] = 80`. Use §2.2 to get the per-step stack; simulate the LTV recursion. Call `freq_map`. |
| 3 | Discrete LTV: step change in stiffness | Same plant but `k[0, :N/2] = 200` and `k[0, N/2:] = 40`; otherwise identical to section 2. |

| 7 | Time-series mode: evolving output spectrum | Fresh simulation of the section-2 LTV plant; hand only the output to `freq_map`; plot the spectrum map. |
| 8 | Duffing hardening oscillator | Use §2.3 with `k_cub = 1e5` and a ramped-amplitude input; call `freq_map` on the response; show the apparent resonance drifting upward over time. Print the small-amplitude and ramped-amplitude effective natural frequencies for context. |

### 3.8 `spectrogram` — Short-time FFT spectrogram

**Goal.** Demonstrate `spectrogram` on a physical SDOF plant driven
by a chirp force. The output response spectrogram shows the chirp
track *modulated* by the plant's own resonance — the ridge lights up
when the chirp sweeps through `ω_n`.

**Plant.** Plant D (§1.4) with `N = 5000`, `Ts = 1/Fs`, `Fs = 1000 Hz`.

**Excitation.** Linear chirp force `u[k] = cos(2π · φ(t_k))` with
instantaneous frequency `f(t) = f₀ + (f₁ − f₀) · t / (2 T_end)` and
`f₀ = 20 Hz`, `f₁ = 60 Hz`. This sweeps through `Plant D`'s resonance
at ≈ 31.83 Hz near `t ≈ 1.5 s`.

**Required sections.**

| # | Section title (SHOULD) | Topic (MUST) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Chirp force driving the SDOF | Build Plant D via §2.1; simulate the state recursion under the chirp input; compute the spectrogram of the position response. |
| 2 | Window length trade-off | Two `spectrogram` calls with short and long window lengths; side-by-side plot. |
| 3 | Window types | Three `spectrogram` calls with `window ∈ {'hann', 'hamming', 'rect'}` at the same length. |
| 4 | Multi-channel signal | Stack the chirp-response (channel 0) with a constant-tone response (channel 1) driven by `u_tone[k] = cos(2π · 50 · t_k)`. Compute a multi-channel spectrogram and plot both channels. |
| 5 | Log frequency scale and NFFT zero-padding | Single `spectrogram` call with `window_length = 128` and `nfft = 1024`; plot with `frequency_scale = 'log'`. |
| 6 | Accessing raw STFT data | Print the dimensions of `result.time`, `result.frequency`, `result.power`, and `result.complex_stft`. |

**Required `sid.*` invocations.**

| # | Function | Options |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `spectrogram` | `window_length = 256`, `sample_time = Ts` |
| 2 | `spectrogram` | two calls: `window_length = 64`, `window_length = 512` |
| 3 | `spectrogram` | three calls: `window = 'hann'`, `'hamming'`, `'rect'`; `window_length = 256` |
| 4 | `spectrogram` | on a two-channel signal `(N, 2)` stacked from the chirp response and the 50 Hz tone response |
| 5 | `spectrogram` | `window_length = 128`, `nfft = 1024`, `sample_time = Ts`; plotted with `frequency_scale = 'log'` |

**Required outputs.**

| Plot (three spectrograms) | 3 | Hann / Hamming / Rectangular. |

### 3.9 `ltv_disc` — LTV state-space identification (COSMIC)

**Goal.** Walk through the full COSMIC workflow — LTI recovery,
LTV recovery with ramping stiffness, multi-trajectory benefit,
validation and frequency-based lambda tuning, preconditioning, cost
decomposition, uncertainty quantification, frozen transfer function,
compare/residual validation — all on a physical 1-DoF SMD plant. End
with a nonlinear Duffing section that recovers the amplitude-
dependent local linearization.

**Plant.** Plant A (§1.1) for all linear sections. Plant E (§1.5) for
the Duffing section (same `m`, `k_lin`, `c`, `F` as Plant A; adds
`k_cub`).

**Dimensions.** `p = 2` (state = `[x, v]`), `q = 1` (single force
input).

**Required sections.**

| # | Section title (SHOULD) | Topic (MUST) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | LTI system recovery | Build `(Ad, Bd)` via §2.1 for Plant A; simulate `L = 10` trajectories of `N = 50` steps with process noise `σ = 0.01`; call `ltv_disc` with `lambda_ = 1e5`; print the true `Ad`, the mean recovered `A(k)` across time, and the Frobenius-norm recovery error. |
| 2 | LTV system: time-varying stiffness | Build an `(n=1, N=80)` `k_spring` array ramping `200 → 50`; use §2.2 for the per-step stack; simulate `L = 15` trajectories with process noise `σ = 0.01`; call `ltv_disc` with `lambda_ = 'auto'`. Plot the recovered `A[1, 0](k)` against the true curve (for a 1-DoF plant with small `Ts`, `Ad[1, 0] ≈ −k(t)·Ts`). |
| 3 | Multi-trajectory benefit | Compare COSMIC recovery with `L = 3` vs `L = 20` trajectories on the section-2 LTV plant. |
| 4 | Validation-based lambda tuning | Split `L = 20` trajectories into 14 train + 6 validation; call `ltv_disc_tune` with `method='validation'` and a log-spaced lambda grid; plot the validation-loss curve. |

| 9 | Frequency-based lambda tuning | Call `ltv_disc_tune` with `method='frequency'` on the section-4 data; compare the tuned λ against the validation-tuned λ. |
| 10 | Model validation with `compare` and `residual` | Call both on the section-2 result; print per-channel NRMSE fits and the whiteness verdict. |
| 11 | Weakly-nonlinear Duffing oscillator | Build Plant E; simulate `L = 12` trajectories over `N = 400` steps with a *ramped-amplitude* white input (amplitude profile `linspace(0.5, 8.0, N)`); call `ltv_disc` with a **small manual lambda** (`lambda_ = 0.1`, not `'auto'`, because auto-tuning over-regularises this dataset); plot the recovered `A[1, 0](k)` and overlay the linearized `Ad[1, 0]` reference from §2.1. |

**Required `sid.*` invocations.**

| # | Function | Options |

### 3.10 `multi_trajectory` — Multi-trajectory ensemble averaging

**Goal.** Show that ensemble averaging across `L` independent
trajectories reduces variance by `1/L` without sacrificing frequency
resolution. Four sub-sections exercise this benefit across all four
spectral estimators: `freq_bt`, `freq_map`, `spectrogram`, `ltv_disc`.

**Plants.**

- Sections 1, 2, 4: Plant B (§1.2) with `F = [[1], [0]]`.
- Section 3: Plant D (§1.4) — chirp driving the high-frequency SDOF.

**Required sections.**

| # | Section title (SHOULD) | Topic (MUST) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | LTI ensemble averaging — tighter confidence bands | Simulate `L = 10` trajectories of Plant B (`N = 2000`, measurement noise `5·10⁻⁴`); compare `freq_bt` confidence bands between a single trajectory and the full ensemble. Print the `response_std` ratio and confirm it is approximately `1/sqrt(L)`. |
| 2 | LTV time-varying map — sharper transition detection | Simulate `L = 5` trajectories of Plant B with a step change `k₁: 200 → 50` at `t = N/2`, `N = 4000`; compare `freq_map` between a single trajectory and the ensemble. |
| 3 | Spectrogram averaging — chirp in noise | Simulate `L = 8` trajectories of Plant D driven by the same chirp but with independent `1·10⁻⁴` noise; compare single-trajectory and ensemble spectrograms. |
| 4 | COSMIC + `freq_map` consistency | Reuse the ltv_disc LTV plant (Plant A 1-DoF with ramping stiffness, `N = 80`, `L = 10`); call `ltv_disc(lambda_='auto', uncertainty=True)` and `freq_map` on the same dataset; print that both identifiers use the same `L` trajectories. |

**Required `sid.*` invocations.**

| # | Function | Options |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `freq_bt` | two calls: single-trajectory and ensemble, `window_size = 80`, `sample_time = Ts` |
| 2 | `freq_map` | two calls: single-trajectory and ensemble, `segment_length = 256`, `sample_time = Ts` |
| 3 | `spectrogram` | two calls: single-trajectory and ensemble, `window_length = 128`, `sample_time = Ts` |
| 4 | `ltv_disc` | `lambda_ = 'auto'`, `uncertainty = True` |
| 4 | `freq_map` | `segment_length = min(N, 30)`, `sample_time = Ts` |

**Required outputs.**

| Kind | Section | Binding content |
|---|---|---|
| Print | 1 | Three lines: single-trajectory max std, ensemble max std, ratio and the expected `1/sqrt(L)`. |
| Plot (two Bode) | 1 | Single-trajectory Bode and ensemble Bode side by side (or stacked). |
| Plot (two magnitude maps) | 2 | Single-trajectory and ensemble `freq_map` magnitude maps side by side. |

### 3.11 `output_cosmic` — LTV identification from partial observations

**Goal.** Demonstrate `ltv_disc_io` (Output-COSMIC) on a natural
partial-observation scenario: a 2-mass mechanical plant with position
sensors on both masses but *no* velocity sensors. The hidden-state
dimension is `n = 4`, the measured dimension is `py = 2`, and COSMIC
must infer the hidden velocities along with the dynamics.

**Plant.** Plant B (§1.2) with `F = [[1], [0]]` (force at mass 1
only). Observation matrix `H = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]` (measure
both positions, velocities hidden).

**Trajectories.** `N = 80`, `L = 10`, `u[k] = 5 · ξ[k]` with `ξ ~
N(0, 1)` (scaled up so displacements reach a few centimetres —
displacement magnitudes that let the identification converge). Process
noise `σ_proc = 1·10⁻³`, measurement noise `σ_meas = 1·10⁻⁴`.

**Important framing note (binding).** Output-COSMIC recovers
`(A, B, x)` up to an *unobservable similarity transform* — element-
wise comparison of the recovered `A`/`B` against the simulation's
`Ad`/`Bd` is **not** a meaningful metric. The validation step MUST be
the gauge-invariant **observation reconstruction error**
`‖H · x̂ − y‖ / ‖y‖`.

**Required sections.**

| # | Section title (SHOULD) | Topic (MUST) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | System setup | Build Plant B; state it is a 4th-order plant with 2 position measurements. Print `Ad` and `H`. |
| 2 | Simulate trajectories | Generate `L = 10` trajectories of length `N = 80` with scaled input and process/measurement noise. |
| 3 | Step 1: estimate frequency response | Call `freq_bt` on the first trajectory (trimming `Y` to match `U`'s length) with `window_size = 20`, `sample_time = Ts`. |
| 4 | Step 2: model-order determination | Call `model_order` on the `freq_bt` result; print the estimate and note that it may overshoot the true order for short lightly-damped records. |
| 5 | Step 3: construct observation matrix | Show `H` and print its shape. |
| 6 | Step 4: identify the LTV model via `ltv_disc_io` | Call `ltv_disc_io(Y, U, H, lambda_=1e5)`; print iterations and final cost. |
| 7 | Convergence history | Plot `cost` vs iteration (semilogy). |
| 8 | State recovery: observed channels vs hidden channels | 2×2 grid: top row shows the two measured positions with true, estimated, and measurement curves; bottom row shows the two hidden velocities with true and estimated curves. |
| 9 | Validation: observation reconstruction error | Compute `H · x̂` for every trajectory and compare against `Y`; print the relative Frobenius error. |
| 10 | Frozen-time inspection of the recovered A and B | Print `A(N/2)` and `B(N/2)` as a sanity check that magnitudes are `O(1)`. |

**Required `sid.*` invocations.**

| # | Function | Options |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `freq_bt` | `window_size = 20`, `sample_time = Ts` |
| 4 | `model_order` | default |
| 6 | `ltv_disc_io` | `lambda_ = 1e5` |

**Required outputs.**

| Kind | Section | Binding content |
|---|---|---|
| Print | 1 | `Ad` matrix and `H` matrix. |
| Print | 2 | Max absolute output and max absolute hidden-velocity value. |
| Print | 3 | `freq_bt` response shape. |
| Print | 4 | `n_est` estimate with a note that it may overshoot. |
| Print | 5 | `H` matrix. |
| Print | 6 | Iterations and final cost. |
| Plot (convergence) | 7 | Semilog `cost` vs iteration. |
| Plot (2×2 grid) | 8 | Four subplots: `x₁`, `x₂`, `v₁`, `v₂` with true/estimated/measured overlays as appropriate. |
| Print | 9 | One line: "Observation reconstruction error: …". |
| Print | 10 | `A(mid)` and `B(mid)` matrices. |

## 4. Conventions

### 4.1 Auto-discovery

Every language port MUST lay out its examples directory so that the
example runner discovers files purely by glob pattern. Hardcoded
manifest lists are non-conformant.

| Language | Directory | Glob pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Python | `python/examples/` | `example_*.ipynb` |
| MATLAB / Octave | `matlab/examples/` | `example*.m` |
| Julia | `julia/examples/` | `example_*.jl` |

The CI test runner (e.g., `pytest --nbmake python/examples/` for
Python, `matlab/examples/runAllExamples.m` for MATLAB) MUST discover
new examples without code changes. This rule mirrors the discovery
convention in `CONTRIBUTING.md` at the repo root.

### 4.2 Self-contained

Every example MUST run top-to-bottom with no external data files. All
simulation data is generated inline via the helper API of §2. Loading
from `testdata/*.json` or any other on-disk fixture is non-conformant.

### 4.3 Outputs cleared

For languages where example files persist runtime outputs (Jupyter
notebooks, R Markdown), every example file MUST be committed with all
outputs cleared. The CI runner validates that the file *executes*
without error; it does not assert output content. MATLAB `.m` scripts,
Julia `.jl` scripts, and similar source-only formats have nothing to
clear.

### 4.4 RNG seeding

Every example MUST fix an RNG seed at the top of its data-generation
section so that a given commit gives deterministic numerical output
within one language.

Seeds are *not* bound across languages. Python's `numpy.random` and
MATLAB's `randn` produce different sequences from the same seed, so
numerical equivalence across languages is not a goal of this spec.
Each port picks seeds that produce visually similar plots; reviewers
compare Python and MATLAB output side by side to catch mismatches,
not by diffing numeric values.

**Recommended convention (SHOULD):** use the same seed value across
languages when possible (e.g., `seed = 42` in both Python's
`default_rng(42)` and MATLAB's `rng(42)`). This makes differences
obvious as RNG differences rather than spec mismatches.

### 4.5 File-name mapping table

Each example's canonical identifier maps to language-specific file
names as follows:

| Identifier | Python (`python/examples/`) | MATLAB (`matlab/examples/`) | Julia (`julia/examples/`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `siso`              | `example_siso.ipynb`              | `exampleSISO.m`             | `example_siso.jl`             |
| `etfe`              | `example_etfe.ipynb`              | `exampleETFE.m`             | `example_etfe.jl`             |
| `freq_dep_res`      | `example_freq_dep_res.ipynb`      | `exampleFreqDepRes.m`       | `example_freq_dep_res.jl`     |
| `coherence`         | `example_coherence.ipynb`         | `exampleCoherence.m`        | `example_coherence.jl`        |
| `method_comparison` | `example_method_comparison.ipynb` | `exampleMethodComparison.m` | `example_method_comparison.jl`|
| `mimo`              | `example_mimo.ipynb`              | `exampleMIMO.m`             | `example_mimo.jl`             |
| `freq_map`          | `example_freq_map.ipynb`          | `exampleFreqMap.m`          | `example_freq_map.jl`         |
| `spectrogram`       | `example_spectrogram.ipynb`       | `exampleSpectrogram.m`      | `example_spectrogram.jl`      |
| `ltv_disc`          | `example_ltv_disc.ipynb`          | `exampleLTVdisc.m`          | `example_ltv_disc.jl`         |
| `multi_trajectory`  | `example_multi_trajectory.ipynb`  | `exampleMultiTrajectory.m`  | `example_multi_trajectory.jl` |
| `output_cosmic`     | `example_output_cosmic.ipynb`     | `exampleOutputCOSMIC.m`     | `example_output_cosmic.jl`    |

Python pattern: `example_` + snake_case + `.ipynb`. MATLAB pattern:
`example` + camelCase + `.m` (matching the existing MATLAB examples in
the repo). Julia pattern: same as Python but with `.jl` extension.

### 4.6 Helper module placement

The `util_msd*` helpers specified in §2 MUST live **inside the
examples directory** as sibling modules, not in the main package.
This reflects their purpose as example fixtures, not part of the
public `sid` API.

| Language | Location |
|---|---|
| Python | `python/examples/util_msd.py` |
| MATLAB | `matlab/examples/util_msd.m`, `matlab/examples/util_msd_ltv.m`, `matlab/examples/util_msd_nl.m` |
| Julia | `julia/examples/util_msd.jl` (module file) |

Notebooks and scripts MUST import the helpers by sibling-path
reference, not by reaching into the main package's internals.

### 4.7 Example file templates and boilerplate

Every language provides templates for writing new examples. Every
example file in this spec MUST follow its language's template:

- Python: notebook with a title markdown cell, an imports code cell
  including `%matplotlib inline`, and one or more paired
  markdown + code cells per §3 section.
- MATLAB: script with a top `%% exampleName` title block comment, an
  imports block (or a runner-style `runner__nCompleted` counter per
  the MATLAB CONTRIBUTING guide), and `%% Section N — Title` block
  comments separating sections. Matching `matlab/examples/example_template.m`.
- Julia: script or notebook per the local language convention.

### 4.8 Import of the local sid package

Every example MUST exercise functions from the local `sid` package
and MUST NOT call any comparable third-party implementation (e.g.,
`scipy.signal.welch`, `control.freqresp`) in places where a `sid.*`
function would be equivalent. Third-party imports are allowed for
utility tasks (plotting, array construction) but never for the
identification or spectral analysis that is the example's subject.

---

## 5. Cross-Language "Equivalence"

This section defines what it means for two language ports to implement
"the same example". It is the reviewer's contract when approving a new
port.

### 5.1 Structural equivalence (binding)

For every example in §3, two conformant ports MUST share:

1. **Section inventory.** The same ordered list of pedagogical
   sections, identified by topic (not verbatim header prose — see
   §0.3). A reviewer comparing the two implementations side by side
   should be able to say "this section on the left corresponds to
   that section on the right" for every section, without ambiguity.
2. **`sid.*` call graph.** The same sequence of `sid.*` function
   calls in the same sections, with the same binding options (§3.X.5
   tables). A port MAY invoke additional language-idiomatic helpers
   (e.g., a MATLAB port might use `fprintf` where Python uses an
   f-string), but every `sid.*` call listed in the spec MUST be
   present.
3. **Plot kinds.** The same kinds of plots (Bode, spectrum, magnitude
   overlay, time-frequency map, spectrogram, time series, 2×2 grid,
   etc.) in the same sections.
4. **Printed line semantics.** The same pieces of information are
   printed, in the same order. "Whiteness test: PASS" in Python is
   equivalent to "Whiteness test: PASS" in MATLAB even if the exact
   formatting differs.

### 5.2 Numerical divergence (not binding)

RNG draws differ across languages. Numerical outputs (fit
percentages, peak magnitudes, exact curve values, iteration counts,
final cost values, recovered matrix entries) are allowed to differ by
any amount consistent with finite-sample variance.

A language port is NOT required to reproduce the Python port's exact
numerical outputs. Bit-identity is a non-goal.

### 5.3 Visual similarity (recommended)

A reviewer comparing side-by-side plots from two ports of the same
example SHOULD be able to identify which example they are looking at
without reading any code or markdown. The resonance should land at
the same frequency, the confidence bands should have similar widths,
the time-frequency ridges should traverse the same diagonal, etc.

This is a judgment test, not a mechanical one. Mismatches that trace
entirely to RNG differences are acceptable; mismatches that trace to
wrong plant parameters or missing `sid.*` calls are not.

### 5.4 Review checklist (per example)

When reviewing a new language port of the example suite, confirm each
item for each example:

```
For example `<identifier>`:

[ ] Plant parameters match §1 exactly.
[ ] The helper functions from §2 are called with the right shapes.
[ ] The ordered list of pedagogical sections matches §3.X.4.
[ ] Every sid.* call listed in §3.X.5 is present with the specified
    options.
[ ] Every plot listed in §3.X.6 is produced with a title that conveys
    the specified topic and with the specified axis labels.
[ ] Every printed line listed in §3.X.6 is produced with the
    specified semantics.
[ ] The example runs to completion in the language's example runner
    (`pytest --nbmake`, `runAllExamples`, etc.).
[ ] Side-by-side visual comparison against the Python reference shows
    similar plot features (resonance peaks in the same places, bands
    of similar width, time-frequency ridges traversing similar
    paths). Differences consistent with RNG noise are acceptable.
[ ] No external data files are loaded (§4.2).
[ ] Outputs are cleared if the file format persists them (§4.3).
[ ] Auto-discovery picks the file up without manifest changes (§4.1).
```

A port that passes all eleven example checklists is conformant.

### 5.5 What this spec does NOT verify

The following are **not** checked by this specification, even though
they are important in their own right:

- **Cross-language numerical agreement at the algorithm level.** That
  is the job of `SPEC.md` and the reference test vectors in
  `testdata/`. The example suite exercises the algorithms as a user
  would; it is not a verification harness for numerical equivalence.
- **Plot styling (colors, fonts, figure sizes).** Ports are free to
  adopt the idiomatic visual style of their plotting library.
- **Internal variable names inside example code.** A port MAY use
  `N_samples` where the Python reference uses `N`; no renaming test
  is performed.
- **Markdown / comment prose.** As stated in §0.3, narrative prose is
  advisory. Only section *topics* are binding.

## 6. Versioning and Change Control

### 6.1 Semantic versioning

This specification uses semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
The current version is printed at the top of the document.

| Change type | Version bump | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Typo fix, clarification, non-binding advisory text | PATCH | Rewording §0.4, fixing a table alignment |
| New example added | MINOR | Adding a 12th example for a new `sid.*` function |
| Plant parameter tweak that preserves the example's pedagogy | MINOR | Changing `c` from 2 to 2.2 because the Bode plot looks nicer |
| New required section inside an existing example | MINOR | Adding a new pedagogical beat to `siso` |
| New binding `sid.*` call inside an existing example | MINOR | Adding a `residual` check where there wasn't one |
| Example removal | MAJOR | Retiring `siso` in favor of something new |
| Plant deletion or renumbering | MAJOR | Removing Plant C |
| Breaking change to a helper API's interface | MAJOR | Changing the argument order of the LTI helper |

### 6.2 Deprecation cycle

When an example is removed, its entry MUST stay in this document with
a "Removed in v1.Y.0" note for at least one full minor cycle before
being deleted. This gives language ports time to delete the
corresponding file during their next catch-up pass.

### 6.3 Authoritative reference implementation

The Python example suite on `main` (or the latest merged PR) is the
reference implementation of this spec at any given commit. If a
conflict arises between this document and the Python port, fix the
spec first (in a dedicated commit) and then update the Python port to
match the spec. Do not silently update the spec to match a Python
drift.

This rule mirrors the "spec is source of truth" principle in the root
`CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### 6.4 Language ports lag the spec

New language ports MAY target any stable minor version of this spec.
A port against v1.0.0 is conformant until v1.0.0 is explicitly
deprecated (major version bump). A port SHOULD update to a newer
minor version when practical, but is not required to chase every
MINOR bump immediately.
