# Output-COSMIC: Extension of COSMIC (Closed-form Optimal data-driven linear time-varying System IdentifiCation) to Partial State Observation

## 1. Problem Statement

Consider a discrete-time linear time-varying (LTV) system with partial state observation:

$$
x(k+1) = A(k)\,x(k) + B(k)\,u(k), \qquad k = 0, \ldots, N-1
$$

$$
y(k) = H\,x(k)
$$

where $x(k) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state, $u(k) \in \mathbb{R}^q$ is a known input, $y(k) \in \mathbb{R}^{p_y}$ is the measurement, and $H \in \mathbb{R}^{p_y \times n}$ is a known, time-invariant observation matrix. The system matrices $A(k) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and $B(k) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times q}$ are unknown and to be estimated.

Standard COSMIC assumes $H = I$ (full state observation). This document extends COSMIC to partial observations ($p_y \leq n$) and over-determined observations ($p_y > n$). When $\operatorname{rank}(H) = n$ (including $p_y \geq n$), the state is exactly recoverable via weighted least squares and no iterative estimation is needed (see Section 4.1, Case 1).

## 2. Joint Objective

Define the combined dynamics matrix $C(k) = \begin{bmatrix} A^\top(k) \\ B^\top(k) \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{(n+q) \times n}$ and the augmented data vector $d(k) = \begin{bmatrix} x(k) \\ u(k) \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{n+q}$.

The joint objective over the state sequence $\mathbf{x} = \{x(k)\}_{k=0}^{N}$ and the dynamics sequence $\mathbf{C} = \{C(k)\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$ is:

$$
J(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{C}) = \sum_{k=0}^{N} \|y(k) - H\,x(k)\|^2_{R^{-1}} + \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \|x(k+1) - A(k)\,x(k) - B(k)\,u(k)\|^2 + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \|C(k) - C(k-1)\|_F^2
$$

where $\|v\|^2_{R^{-1}} = v^\top R^{-1} v$ denotes the Mahalanobis norm with respect to the measurement noise covariance $R \in \mathbb{R}^{p_y \times p_y}$ (symmetric positive definite), and:

- **Observation fidelity** ($R^{-1}$ term): penalises deviation of the estimated state from measurements, weighted by the measurement information matrix $R^{-1}$. This naturally downweights noisy measurement channels and upweights precise ones. If $R$ is unknown, setting $R = I$ recovers unweighted least squares.
- **Dynamics fidelity** (middle term): penalises deviation from the estimated dynamics model, coupling $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{C}$.
- **Dynamics smoothness** ($\lambda$ term): the standard COSMIC regulariser, penalising rapid variation of the system matrices between consecutive time steps.

### 2.1 Recovery of Standard COSMIC

When $H = I$ (full state observation), taking $R \to 0$ (infinite measurement precision) forces $x(k) = y(k)$ exactly. The observation fidelity term vanishes (it is zero at the constraint), the state is no longer a free variable, and $J$ reduces to the standard COSMIC cost:

$$
J(\mathbf{C}) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \|y(k+1) - C^\top(k)\,d(k)\|^2 + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \|C(k) - C(k-1)\|_F^2
$$

which is exactly the original COSMIC formulation of Carvalho et al. (2022). No additional hyperparameters are introduced in the fully-observed case.

## 3. Multi-Trajectory Extension

Assume $L$ trajectories are collected, each of length $N+1$ time steps, under the same LTV dynamics $\{A(k), B(k)\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$. Denote the state and output of trajectory $l$ at time $k$ as $x_l(k)$ and $y_l(k)$ respectively. The joint objective generalises to:

$$
J(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{C}) = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{k=0}^{N} \|y_l(k) - H\,x_l(k)\|^2_{R^{-1}} + \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \|x_l(k+1) - A(k)\,x_l(k) - B(k)\,u_l(k)\|^2 + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \|C(k) - C(k-1)\|_F^2
$$

The dynamics smoothness term is shared across trajectories (single $\mathbf{C}$), while the observation and dynamics fidelity terms are summed over trajectories. Each trajectory has its own state sequence $\{x_l(k)\}$ but shares the same $\{C(k)\}$.

## 4. Alternating Minimisation Algorithm

The objective $J(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{C})$ is non-convex jointly (due to the bilinear coupling $A(k)\,x(k)$), but is strictly convex in each block separately when the other is held fixed (given $\lambda > 0$ and $R$ positive definite). This motivates a two-block alternating minimisation scheme.

### 4.1 Initialisation

The initialisation strategy depends on the rank of $H$.

**Case 1: $\operatorname{rank}(H) = n$ (full-rank fast path).** When $H$ has full column rank (including $H = I$ and tall matrices with $p_y > n$), the state $x(k)$ is exactly recoverable from $y(k)$ via weighted least squares:

$$
\hat{x}(k) = (H^\top R^{-1} H)^{-1} H^\top R^{-1}\, y(k)
$$

This eliminates the state as a free variable. A single COSMIC step on the recovered states produces the final $A(k)$, $B(k)$ — no alternating loop is needed. The observation fidelity term achieves its minimum at the weighted LS solution for each time step independently. The total cost is $O(N\,p_y\,n + N\,(n+q)^3)$, with no iterations.

**Case 2: $\operatorname{rank}(H) < n$ (partial observation).** When $H$ is rank-deficient, the state cannot be recovered from measurements alone. The algorithm uses an LTI frequency-domain initialisation followed by alternating minimisation:

1. **LTI initialisation (`sidLTIfreqIO`).** Estimate constant dynamics $(A_0, B_0)$ from the I/O transfer function $G(e^{j\omega}) = H(e^{j\omega}I - A_0)^{-1}B_0$ via Blackman-Tukey spectral estimation and Ho-Kalman realization. The realization is transformed to the $H$-basis so that $C_r = H$ in the observation equation. Set $A(k) = A_0$, $B(k) = B_0$ for all $k$. This provides an observable initialisation for any $H$.

2. Enter the alternating loop (Section 4.2).

**Alternative initialisation (composite $A = I$ solve).** When $H$ has full column rank, one can also evaluate $J$ at $A(k) = I$ and jointly solve for $\{x_l(k)\}$ and $\{B(k)\}$:

$$
J_{\text{init}}(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{B}) = J(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{C})\big|_{A(k)=I} = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{k=0}^{N} \|y_l(k) - H\,x_l(k)\|^2_{R^{-1}} + \sum_{l=1}^{L} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \|x_l(k+1) - x_l(k) - B(k)\,u_l(k)\|^2 + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \|B(k) - B(k-1)\|_F^2
$$

This is jointly convex (no bilinear terms). The minimiser is unique and obtained in a single forward-backward pass over composite blocks (Appendix B). Since $J_{\text{init}} = J\big|_{A=I}$, this is the exact minimisation of the global objective over a restricted subspace. However, the full-rank fast path above is strictly simpler (no composite block system needed) and produces the same result when followed by a COSMIC step. The composite $A = I$ solve cannot be used when $\operatorname{rank}(H) < n$ because the observability matrix $\mathcal{O} = [H;\, HA;\, HA^2;\, \ldots]$ with $A = I$ has rank $p_y < n$ and the composite system is structurally singular.

### 4.2 Alternating Loop

Starting from the initialisation, the algorithm alternates between two steps:

**State Step.** Fix $\mathbf{C} = \{C(k)\}$, solve for $\mathbf{x} = \{x(k)\}$:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \; \sum_{k=0}^{N} \|y(k) - H\,x(k)\|^2_{R^{-1}} + \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \|x(k+1) - A(k)\,x(k) - B(k)\,u(k)\|^2
$$

This is a linear least-squares problem in $\{x(k)\}$. It is exactly the Rauch–Tung–Striebel (RTS) smoother with measurement noise covariance $R$ and process noise covariance $Q = I$, conditioned on the full observation sequence $\{y(k)\}_{k=0}^{N}$. The solution is unique and can be computed in $O(N\,n^3)$ time via the forward-backward recursion derived in Appendix A.

For multi-trajectory: the state step decouples across trajectories (each trajectory has its own state sequence but uses the shared $\mathbf{C}$), so $L$ independent smoothers are run.

**COSMIC Step.** Fix $\mathbf{x} = \{x(k)\}$ (or $\mathbf{X} = \{X(k)\}$ for multi-trajectory), solve for $\mathbf{C}$:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{C}} \; \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \|x(k+1) - C^\top(k)\,d(k)\|^2 + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \|C(k) - C(k-1)\|_F^2
$$

This is exactly the standard COSMIC problem with $x(k)$ replacing the measured state. The observation fidelity term does not involve $\mathbf{C}$ and is therefore constant in this step. The solution is obtained via the COSMIC tridiagonal closed-form algorithm in $O(N\,(n+q)^3)$ time.

For multi-trajectory: the data matrices $D(k) = \begin{bmatrix} X(k) \\ U(k) \end{bmatrix}$ and targets $X'(k) = X(k+1)$ pool across trajectories exactly as in the standard multi-trajectory COSMIC formulation.

### 4.3 Trust-Region Interpolation (Optional)

In cases where the transition from the initialisation ($A = I$) to the first COSMIC estimate of $A(k)$ is too abrupt — for instance with high noise, long trajectories, or poorly conditioned data — a trust-region mechanism can be employed.

Define the interpolated dynamics matrix:

$$
\tilde{A}(k) = (1 - \mu)\,A(k) + \mu\,I
$$

where $\mu \in [0, 1]$ is the trust-region parameter. The state step uses $\tilde{A}(k)$ in place of $A(k)$:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \; \sum_{k} \|y(k) - H\,x(k)\|^2_{R^{-1}} + \sum_{k} \|x(k+1) - \tilde{A}(k)\,x(k) - B(k)\,u(k)\|^2
$$

The COSMIC step is unaffected (it always solves for $A(k)$ and $B(k)$ freely).

**Adaptive schedule.** The trust-region parameter $\mu$ is managed by an outer loop wrapping the alternating minimisation:

1. Initialise $\mu = 1$ (which reduces the first state step to the $A = I$ initialisation).
2. Run the alternating state–COSMIC loop to convergence for the current $\mu$, yielding $J^*(\mu)$.
3. Reduce $\mu$: set $\mu \leftarrow \mu / 2$.
4. Run the alternating loop to convergence with the new $\mu$, yielding $J^*(\mu/2)$.
5. **Accept/reject:** If $J^*(\mu/2) \leq J^*(\mu)$, accept the reduction and continue from step 3. If $J^*(\mu/2) > J^*(\mu)$, increase $\mu$ back (set $\mu \leftarrow \min(2\mu, 1)$) and terminate.
6. Terminate when $\mu < \varepsilon$ (e.g., $\varepsilon = 10^{-6}$) and set $\mu = 0$ for a final pass.

At each value of $\mu$, the inner alternating loop minimises a well-defined objective (with $\tilde{A}(k)$ fixed for the duration of that inner loop), so the monotone decrease guarantee holds within each inner loop. The outer loop provides a monotone homotopy from the robust random-walk model ($\mu = 1$) to the fully dynamics-informed model ($\mu = 0$).

**When $\mu = 0$ throughout:** the trust-region mechanism is inactive and the algorithm reduces to the base two-block alternation described in Section 4.2, with a single initialisation step at $A = I$. This is expected to be sufficient for most practical cases.

## 5. Convergence Analysis

### 5.1 Monotone Decrease

**Proposition 1.** *Let $(\mathbf{x}^{(t)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t)})$ denote the iterates of the alternating minimisation (Section 4.2) at iteration $t$. Then the sequence $\{J(\mathbf{x}^{(t)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t)})\}$ is monotonically non-increasing.*

*Proof.* At each iteration:

1. The state step sets $\mathbf{x}^{(t+1)} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{x}} J(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{C}^{(t)})$, so $J(\mathbf{x}^{(t+1)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t)}) \leq J(\mathbf{x}^{(t)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t)})$.
2. The COSMIC step sets $\mathbf{C}^{(t+1)} = \arg\min_{\mathbf{C}} J(\mathbf{x}^{(t+1)}, \mathbf{C})$, so $J(\mathbf{x}^{(t+1)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t+1)}) \leq J(\mathbf{x}^{(t+1)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t)})$.

Combining: $J(\mathbf{x}^{(t+1)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t+1)}) \leq J(\mathbf{x}^{(t)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t)})$. Since $J \geq 0$, the sequence converges. $\square$

### 5.2 Convergence to a Stationary Point

**Proposition 2.** *Every limit point of the sequence $\{(\mathbf{x}^{(t)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t)})\}$ is a stationary point of $J$.*

*Proof.* Both subproblems are strictly convex (the state step has $R^{-1} \succ 0$ ensuring strict convexity in $\mathbf{x}$; the COSMIC step has $\lambda > 0$ ensuring strict convexity in $\mathbf{C}$), so each block minimiser is unique. This satisfies the conditions of the two-block alternating minimisation convergence theorem (Grippo and Sciandrone, 2000, Theorem 2.1): for two-block problems where each block minimiser is unique, every limit point of the alternating sequence is a stationary point of the joint objective. $\square$

### 5.3 Non-Convexity and Global Optimality

The joint objective $J(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{C})$ is non-convex due to the bilinear term $A(k)\,x(k)$ in the dynamics fidelity. Multiple stationary points may exist. In particular, a similarity transformation $T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ (invertible) maps any solution $(x(k), A(k), B(k))$ to an equivalent solution $(T\,x(k),\; T\,A(k)\,T^{-1},\; T\,B(k))$ with identical cost. The observation term $\|y(k) - H\,x(k)\|^2_{R^{-1}}$ breaks this symmetry partially (requiring $H\,T^{-1}$ to produce the same outputs), but does not eliminate it unless $H$ has full column rank.

Global optimality is therefore not guaranteed. The initialisation (Section 4.1) and optional trust-region mechanism (Section 4.3) serve to place the iterates in a favourable basin of attraction.

### 5.4 Trust-Region Convergence

**Proposition 3.** *The outer trust-region loop (Section 4.3) produces a monotonically non-increasing sequence of converged objectives $\{J^*(\mu_s)\}$ as long as reductions are accepted.*

*Proof.* At each outer iteration $s$, the inner alternating loop converges to a stationary point for fixed $\mu_s$ (Propositions 1–2). A reduction $\mu_{s+1} = \mu_s / 2$ is accepted only if $J^*(\mu_{s+1}) \leq J^*(\mu_s)$. If the reduction is rejected, the algorithm reverts to $\mu_s$ and terminates. Therefore, the accepted sequence of $J^*$ values is monotonically non-increasing, and the algorithm terminates in a finite number of outer iterations (since $\mu$ halves at each accepted step and terminates below $\varepsilon$). $\square$

## 6. Similarity Transformation Ambiguity

As noted in Section 5.3, the output-COSMIC problem admits equivalent solutions under state-space similarity transformations. For any invertible $T$:

$$
\tilde{x}(k) = T\,x(k), \quad \tilde{A}(k) = T\,A(k)\,T^{-1}, \quad \tilde{B}(k) = T\,B(k), \quad \tilde{H} = H\,T^{-1}
$$

produces identical input-output behaviour. Since $H$ is fixed and known, the transformation is constrained by $H = \tilde{H}\,T = H\,T^{-1}\,T = H$, which is automatically satisfied — the point is that different initialisations may converge to different (but equivalent) state-space realisations.

This ambiguity is inherent to all output-based system identification methods and does not affect prediction or control design (which depend only on input-output behaviour). If a canonical form is desired, it can be imposed as a post-processing step (e.g., balanced realisation, observable canonical form).

## 7. Algorithm Summary

**Algorithm: Output-COSMIC**

**Input:** Measurements $\{y_l(k)\}$ for $l = 1, \ldots, L$, $k = 0, \ldots, N$; inputs $\{u_l(k)\}$ for $l = 1, \ldots, L$, $k = 0, \ldots, N-1$; observation matrix $H$; measurement noise covariance $R$ (or $R = I$ if unknown); regularisation weight $\lambda$; convergence tolerance $\varepsilon_J$; optional trust-region parameters $(\mu_0, \varepsilon_\mu)$.

**Output:** Estimated dynamics $\{A(k), B(k)\}_{k=0}^{N-1}$; estimated states $\{x_l(k)\}$.

**Initialisation:**
1. Solve $J_{\text{init}} = J\big|_{A=I}$ (Section 4.1) for $\{x_l(k)\}$ and $\{B(k)\}$ jointly, pooling across all $L$ trajectories. Store $\mathbf{X}^{(0)}$, $\mathbf{B}^{(0)}$. Set $A^{(0)}(k) = I$ for all $k$.

**Main loop** (iteration $t = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$):
2. **COSMIC step:** Using the current state estimates $\mathbf{X}^{(t)}$, solve the standard COSMIC problem (Section 4.2) pooling across trajectories. Obtain $\mathbf{C}^{(t+1)} = \{A^{(t+1)}(k), B^{(t+1)}(k)\}$.
3. **State step:** Using $\mathbf{C}^{(t+1)}$ (with trust-region interpolation $\tilde{A}(k) = (1-\mu)\,A^{(t+1)}(k) + \mu\,I$ if enabled), run the RTS smoother for each trajectory independently. Obtain $\mathbf{X}^{(t+1)}$.
4. Evaluate $J^{(t+1)} = J(\mathbf{X}^{(t+1)}, \mathbf{C}^{(t+1)})$.
5. If $|J^{(t+1)} - J^{(t)}| / |J^{(t)}| < \varepsilon_J$, declare convergence for the current $\mu$.

**Trust-region outer loop** (if enabled):
6. If $\mu > \varepsilon_\mu$: set $\mu \leftarrow \mu / 2$, warm-start from current iterates, return to step 2.
7. If $\mu \leq \varepsilon_\mu$: set $\mu = 0$, run steps 2–5 one final time.

**When $H = I$:** Take $R \to 0$ (or equivalently fix $x_l(k) = y_l(k)$). The state step is trivial, the initialisation is unnecessary, and the algorithm reduces to a single COSMIC solve — the original algorithm.

## 8. Computational Complexity

- **Initialisation:** Single forward-backward pass with composite blocks, $O(N\,(Ln + nq)^3)$. For large $L$, exploitable structure reduces to $O(N\,(n^3 L + (nq)^3))$.
- **State step:** RTS smoother, $O(N\,n^3)$ per trajectory, $O(L\,N\,n^3)$ total.
- **COSMIC step:** Standard COSMIC tridiagonal solve, $O(N\,(n+q)^3)$, independent of $L$ (trajectories are pooled into the data matrices).
- **Per outer iteration:** $O(L\,N\,n^3 + N\,(n+q)^3)$.
- **Total:** Proportional to the number of inner iterations times the number of trust-region steps. In practice, convergence is expected within a small number of alternating iterations (typically 5–20), and trust-region steps (typically 0–5 if enabled).

The linear scaling in $N$ — the hallmark of COSMIC — is preserved.

## 9. Hyperparameter Selection

**$\lambda$ (dynamics smoothness):** Same role and selection criteria as in standard COSMIC. Controls the trade-off between data fidelity and temporal smoothness of the estimated system matrices.

**$R$ (measurement noise covariance):** The measurement noise covariance matrix, weighting the observation fidelity term via $R^{-1}$. When $R$ is known from sensor specifications or calibration, it is used directly — no tuning is required for the observation term. When $R$ is unknown, setting $R = I$ recovers unweighted least squares. The relative scaling between $R^{-1}$ and the dynamics fidelity term (which implicitly assumes unit process noise covariance) determines the balance between trusting measurements and trusting the dynamics model.

**$\mu$ (trust-region):** Start at $\mu = 1$ if used, halve adaptively. For well-conditioned problems, $\mu = 0$ from iteration 2 onward (i.e., trust-region disabled) is expected to suffice.

## 10. Relationship to Existing Methods

**Expectation-Maximisation (EM) for LTV systems.** The alternating scheme is structurally identical to EM for linear dynamical systems: the state step is the E-step (state smoothing given parameters), the COSMIC step is the M-step (parameter estimation given states). The key difference is that the M-step uses COSMIC's smoothness regularisation rather than maximum likelihood, making this a MAP-EM algorithm.

**Subspace identification (N4SID, MOESP).** These methods can provide alternative initialisations by estimating a local LTI model within sliding windows. The $A = I$ initialisation proposed here avoids the stationarity assumption inherent in windowed subspace methods and is better suited for systems with continuous parameter variation.

**Kalman smoother.** The state step is exactly an RTS smoother. Output-COSMIC can be viewed as wrapping a Kalman smoother with a COSMIC parameter estimator in an EM loop, with the COSMIC smoothness prior replacing the standard ML parameter update.

## Appendix A. Forward-Backward Recursion for the State Step

### A.1 Normal Equations

Given $A(k)$, $B(k)$ for $k = 0, \ldots, N-1$, observation matrix $H$, noise covariance $R$, measurements $y(k)$ for $k = 0, \ldots, N$, and inputs $u(k)$ for $k = 0, \ldots, N-1$, the state step minimises:

$$
\min_{\{x(k)\}} \sum_{k=0}^{N} \|y(k) - H\,x(k)\|^2_{R^{-1}} + \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \|x(k+1) - A(k)\,x(k) - B(k)\,u(k)\|^2
$$

Setting $\partial J / \partial x(k) = 0$ for each $k$ yields a block tridiagonal system in $x(0), \ldots, x(N)$ with $n \times n$ blocks. Define $b(k) = B(k)\,u(k)$ for notational convenience.

**Diagonal blocks:**

$$
S_0 = H^\top R^{-1} H + A(0)^\top A(0)
$$

$$
S_k = H^\top R^{-1} H + I + A(k)^\top A(k), \qquad k = 1, \ldots, N-1
$$

$$
S_N = H^\top R^{-1} H + I
$$

**Off-diagonal blocks** (super-diagonal, coupling equation $k$ to unknown $x(k+1)$):

$$
U_k = -A(k)^\top, \qquad k = 0, \ldots, N-1
$$

By symmetry of the Hessian, the sub-diagonal block coupling equation $k$ to $x(k-1)$ is $L_k = U_{k-1}^\top = -A(k-1)$.

**Right-hand side:**

$$
\Theta_0 = H^\top R^{-1} y(0) - A(0)^\top b(0)
$$

$$
\Theta_k = H^\top R^{-1} y(k) + b(k-1) - A(k)^\top b(k), \qquad k = 1, \ldots, N-1
$$

$$
\Theta_N = H^\top R^{-1} y(N) + b(N-1)
$$

### A.2 Forward-Backward Algorithm

The block tridiagonal system is solved by Gaussian elimination in the forward direction, followed by back-substitution. This is algebraically equivalent to the Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother.

**Forward pass** ($k = 0$ to $N$):

$$
\Lambda_0 = S_0
$$

$$
Y_0 = \Lambda_0^{-1}\,\Theta_0
$$

For $k = 1, \ldots, N$:

$$
\Lambda_k = S_k - A(k-1)\,\Lambda_{k-1}^{-1}\,A(k-1)^\top
$$

$$
Y_k = \Lambda_k^{-1}\bigl(\Theta_k + A(k-1)\,Y_{k-1}\bigr)
$$

**Backward pass** ($k = N-1$ to $0$):

$$
x(N) = Y_N
$$

For $k = N-1, \ldots, 0$:

$$
x(k) = Y_k + \Lambda_k^{-1}\,A(k)^\top\,x(k+1)
$$

**Complexity:** $O(N\,n^3)$ per trajectory, $O(L\,N\,n^3)$ total. Each trajectory is independent.

### A.3 Connection to COSMIC

This recursion is structurally identical to the COSMIC forward-backward pass (Section 4.2, COSMIC Step). The correspondence is:

| COSMIC (dynamics estimation) | State step (state estimation) |
|---|---|
| Off-diagonal: $\lambda_{k+1}\,I$ | Off-diagonal: $A(k)^\top$ |
| Diagonal: $D(k)^\top D(k) + (\lambda_k + \lambda_{k+1})\,I$ | Diagonal: $H^\top R^{-1} H + I + A(k)^\top A(k)$ |
| Unknown: $C(k) \in \mathbb{R}^{(n+q) \times n}$ | Unknown: $x(k) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ |
| Backward: $C(k) = Y_k + \lambda_{k+1}\,\Lambda_k^{-1}\,C(k+1)$ | Backward: $x(k) = Y_k + \Lambda_k^{-1}\,A(k)^\top\,x(k+1)$ |

The only structural difference is that the off-diagonal blocks in COSMIC are $\lambda_k\,I$ (scalar times identity), while in the state step they are $A(k)^\top$ (a general $n \times n$ matrix). The forward-backward pattern is identical.

### A.4 Storage

Store $\Lambda_k^{-1}$ and $Y_k$ for $k = 0, \ldots, N$ during the forward pass (total: $(N+1)$ matrices of size $n \times n$ each, plus $(N+1)$ vectors of size $n$). These are reused in the backward pass. The same stored $\Lambda_k^{-1}$ can be reused across EM iterations if $A(k)$ has not changed significantly (warm-starting), though for correctness they must be recomputed whenever $C$ changes.

## Appendix B. Initialisation Solve

### B.1 Problem Structure

The initialisation minimises $J_{\text{init}} = J\big|_{A=I}$ jointly over $\{x_l(k)\}$ and $\{B(k)\}$. This is a single convex quadratic with a unique minimiser. Since $B(k)\,u_l(k)$ is linear in $B(k)$ (because $u_l(k)$ is known data) and $x_l(k)$ appears linearly, there is no bilinear coupling between the two sets of unknowns. The joint normal equations form a block tridiagonal system in time that is solved in a single forward-backward pass.

### B.2 Composite Unknowns

Define the composite unknown at each time step:

$$
w(k) = \begin{bmatrix} x_1(k) \\ \vdots \\ x_L(k) \\ \text{vec}(B(k)) \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{Ln + nq}, \qquad k = 0, \ldots, N-1
$$

$$
w(N) = \begin{bmatrix} x_1(N) \\ \vdots \\ x_L(N) \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{Ln}
$$

The normal equations $\partial J_{\text{init}} / \partial w(k) = 0$ form a block tridiagonal system in $w(0), \ldots, w(N)$.

### B.3 Block Definitions

For each trajectory $l$, define $e_l(k) = u_l(k)^\top \otimes I_n \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times nq}$, which maps $\text{vec}(B(k))$ to $B(k)\,u_l(k)$. Stack these: $E(k) = [e_1(k);\; \ldots;\; e_L(k)] \in \mathbb{R}^{Ln \times nq}$.

**Diagonal blocks** (interior $0 < k < N$):

$$
S_k = \begin{bmatrix} I_L \otimes (H^\top R^{-1} H + 2I_n) & E(k) - E(k-1) \\ (E(k) - E(k-1))^\top & P(k) + 2\lambda\,I_{nq} \end{bmatrix}
$$

where $P(k) = \sum_{l=1}^{L} (u_l(k)\,u_l(k)^\top) \otimes I_n \in \mathbb{R}^{nq \times nq}$ is the pooled input Gram matrix.

The $x$–$B$ coupling block $E(k) - E(k-1)$ arises because the equation for $x_l(k)$ involves $+B(k)\,u_l(k) - B(k-1)\,u_l(k-1)$: the current $B(k)$ from the dynamics residual at $k$, and the previous $B(k-1)$ from the dynamics residual at $k-1$.

**Boundary diagonal blocks:**

$$
S_0 = \begin{bmatrix} I_L \otimes (H^\top R^{-1} H + I_n) & E(0) \\ E(0)^\top & P(0) + \lambda\,I_{nq} \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
S_N = I_L \otimes (H^\top R^{-1} H + I_n) \qquad \text{(no $B$ block at $k = N$)}
$$

**Off-diagonal blocks** (super-diagonal, coupling $w(k)$ to $w(k+1)$, for $0 \leq k \leq N-2$):

$$
U_k = \begin{bmatrix} -I_L \otimes I_n & 0 \\ -E(k)^\top & -\lambda\,I_{nq} \end{bmatrix}
$$

The top-left block $-I_L \otimes I_n$ is the $x(k) \to x(k+1)$ coupling through the dynamics (with $A = I$). The bottom-left block $-E(k)^\top$ is the $B(k) \to x(k+1)$ coupling. The bottom-right block $-\lambda\,I_{nq}$ is the smoothness coupling $B(k) \to B(k+1)$.

For $k = N-1$: $U_{N-1} = \begin{bmatrix} -I_L \otimes I_n \\ -E(N-1)^\top \end{bmatrix}$ (no $B$ column at $k = N$).

**Right-hand side:**

$$
\Theta_0 = \begin{bmatrix} [H^\top R^{-1} y_1(0);\; \ldots;\; H^\top R^{-1} y_L(0)] \\ 0_{nq} \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\Theta_k = \begin{bmatrix} [H^\top R^{-1} y_1(k);\; \ldots;\; H^\top R^{-1} y_L(k)] \\ 0_{nq} \end{bmatrix}, \qquad 0 < k < N
$$

$$
\Theta_N = [H^\top R^{-1} y_1(N);\; \ldots;\; H^\top R^{-1} y_L(N)]
$$

### B.4 Forward-Backward Algorithm

The same forward-backward algorithm as Appendix A applies with the composite blocks:

**Forward pass** ($k = 0$ to $N$):

$$
\Lambda_0 = S_0, \qquad Y_0 = \Lambda_0^{-1}\,\Theta_0
$$

For $k = 1, \ldots, N$:

$$
\Lambda_k = S_k - U_{k-1}^\top\,\Lambda_{k-1}^{-1}\,U_{k-1}
$$

$$
Y_k = \Lambda_k^{-1}\bigl(\Theta_k + U_{k-1}^\top\,Y_{k-1}\bigr)
$$

Note: $L_k = U_{k-1}^\top$ by symmetry of the Hessian. The sign convention matches: $U_{k-1}^\top\,\Lambda_{k-1}^{-1}\,U_{k-1}$ is the Schur complement elimination of $w(k-1)$ from the equation for $w(k)$, and $U_{k-1}^\top\,Y_{k-1}$ propagates the eliminated RHS forward.

**Backward pass** ($k = N-1$ to $0$):

$$
w(N) = Y_N
$$

For $k = N-1, \ldots, 0$:

$$
w(k) = Y_k + \Lambda_k^{-1}\,U_k\,w(k+1)
$$

Note: the sign in $+\Lambda_k^{-1}\,U_k\,w(k+1)$ accounts for $U_k$ already carrying the negative sign (e.g., $-I_L \otimes I_n$ in the top-left).

Wait — let me be precise. In the backward substitution for a system $\Lambda_k\,w(k) + U_k\,w(k+1) = \tilde{\Theta}_k$, we get $w(k) = \Lambda_k^{-1}(\tilde{\Theta}_k - U_k\,w(k+1)) = Y_k - \Lambda_k^{-1}\,U_k\,w(k+1)$.

Since $U_k$ contains negative entries (e.g., $-I$), the double negative gives a positive contribution, matching the COSMIC backward pass.

**Backward pass** (corrected):

$$
w(N) = Y_N
$$

For $k = N-1, \ldots, 0$:

$$
w(k) = Y_k - \Lambda_k^{-1}\,U_k\,w(k+1)
$$

After the backward pass, extract $x_l(k)$ and $B(k)$ from each $w(k)$.

### B.5 Complexity

Each forward or backward step involves operations on blocks of size $(Ln + nq)$. The dominant cost is the matrix inversion $\Lambda_k^{-1}$ at each step: $O((Ln + nq)^3)$. Total: $O(N\,(Ln + nq)^3)$.

For typical problem sizes ($L \leq 10$, $n \leq 10$, $q \leq 5$), the block dimension is at most $\sim 150$, and the cubic cost is negligible. For very large $L$, the block-diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of $S_k$ (the $x$-blocks are independent across trajectories, coupled only through $B$) can be exploited via the Woodbury identity to reduce cost to $O(N\,(n^3 L + (nq)^3))$.

### B.6 Transition to Main Loop

After the forward-backward pass, the estimated $\{x_l(k)\}$ and $\{B(k)\}$ are stored as $\mathbf{X}^{(0)}$ and $\mathbf{B}^{(0)}$, with $A^{(0)}(k) = I$ for all $k$. The main alternating loop (Section 4.2) begins with the COSMIC step, which estimates $A(k)$ and refines $B(k)$ using the full $C(k) = [A^\top(k);\; B^\top(k)]$ parameterisation.
